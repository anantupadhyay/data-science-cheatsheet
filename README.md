## Accuracy - 
Accuracy is the measure of a classification model. It is a ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations.

## Activation Function -
Activation functions are used to provide non-linear properties to the neural network. It is applied to the weighted sum of the inputs of a neuron in a neural network.

### What is the need of non-linearity - 
Neural-Networks are considered Universal Function Approximators. That's why we need an activation function which allows our model to approximate any function.
